PARSING ENGINE:
- Layer-based

"Engine" Layer:
Accepts engine-level commands
{system}: version, help, quit, load/loadgame
'quit' has a catch to ask player to save if in a save-enabled input loop,
	else it confirms the player's need to exit notifying them of the inability to save
	(any way you look at it, 'quit' has a player confirmation for its use)
{file}: loadsave, save
There are three savegame types:
	1. Multi-file
	2. Single-file
	3. Disabled

"Game" Layer:
Accepts command to interact with the game


LOGIC FLOW:
PLAYER INPUT (in loop on Main) ->
PASS INPUT AS STRING TO INSTANCE OF Command ->
Command CHECKS CURRENT STATE ->
PARSES AS {system} (if available in state) ->
PARSES AS {file} (if available in state) ->
PARSES 


Other Notes:
- Main input inside a stage's <loop> should be typed as 'loop' in order to enable system and file commands, both of those can be manually enabled or disabled using
	system_enabled, system_disabled, file_enabled, file_disabled
